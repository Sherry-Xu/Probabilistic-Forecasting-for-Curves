# Probabilistic-Forecasting-for-Curves

PreditInt_F.R contains all the functions that are used in SimulationExperiments.R and RealDataAnalysis.R

SimulationExperiments.R is for simulation experiments using the settings specified in parameters.R

RealDataAnalysis.R is for probabilistic forecasting for electricity load curves

Alternative_GAM_ARMAerrorcorrection_Recursive.R, Alternative_SAR_ARMAerrorcorrection_Recursive.R and Alternative_SARX_ARMAerrorcorrection_Recursive.R are the codes for the three alternative models used in the paper
